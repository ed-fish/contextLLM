    "summary": "The video discusses the term 'audism' and whether it is a crutch or a tool for the Deaf community. The speaker argues against abandoning the term, stating that 'audism' helps identify specific problems of discrimination that the general term 'discrimination' fails to address. When used as a tool, 'audism' can help those in the community be aware of the existence of an issue and identify its source. However, it can be misused and become an impediment to progress if it is used as a crutch and give up easily.",
