The speaker argues against abandoning the term, stating that 'audism' helps identify specific problems of discrimination that the general term 'discrimination' fails to address. When used as a tool, 'audism' can help those in the community be aware of the existence of an issue and identify its source. However, it can be misused and become an impediment to progress if it is used as a crutch and give up easily.",

Preschool is for children aged 3-4, focusing on vocabulary and socialization through play. TK is for children turning 5 between September 2nd and December 2nd, offering age-appropriate curriculum in a public school setting. Pre-Kindergarten is for older preschoolers preparing for Kindergarten, with less play and more classroom focus. Kindergarten is more academically challenging and longer in duration. The video encourages parents to research and contact the presenter with questions.",
